## Data Storage

### Local Storage
Most of your data (pantry, meal plans, shopping lists, favorites) is stored locally on your device.

We may share anonymized, aggregated data (such as total number of app users or popular recipe searches) that cannot be used to identify you.

## Data Retention

Your data remains on your device until you delete the app or clear app data. If you use iCloud sync, data is retained according to Apple's iCloud policies.

## Your Rights

## Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
